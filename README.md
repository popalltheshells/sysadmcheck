# sysadmcheck
During pentest, I look for the most annoying yet crucial misconfigurations as part of a more "holistic" approach to security. Mostly findings that are not directly exploitable, more a result of work of a non-security experienced sysadmins. These are a compilation of scripts used to automate those tasks.

Each script should be stored with the list.txt file.
list.txt file should contain 'net users /domain' results, separated by new line (\n)
